# Car app

A simple project intended to familiarize myself with Three.js and Svelte frameworks.

Models are using .gltf format and statically loaded.

## Installation
```
npm run install
npm run dev
```
## Usage
You can rotate the camera with left mouse button and pan around with right mouse button.
Mouse scroll to zoom.
Touch controls on phone also work as you would expect.
Camera mouse controls are just using the stock Three.js OrbitControls add-on.

You can swap around the chassis, wheels and background hdri image with on-screen controls.
## Deployment
You can play around the deployed app at:
